# Detailed Implementation Plan for the WPF ToDo Desktop Application

This plan outlines the creation of a modern WPF desktop application that manages ToDo tasks. It incorporates data persistence (using a local JSON file for simplicity), categories/tags, due dates with reminders, priority levels, and dark/light theme support using dynamic resource dictionaries. The project follows the MVVM design pattern to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Project Structure and Files

- **Solution File:** TodoApp.sln
- **Main Application Files:**
  - **App.xaml & App.xaml.cs:** Entry point and merged resource dictionaries for themes.
- **Models:**
  - **Models/TodoItem.cs:** Contains the data model for ToDo items.
- **ViewModels:**
  - **ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs:** Implements INotifyPropertyChanged; holds an ObservableCollection<TodoItem> and ICommand implementations for Add, Edit, and Delete.
- **Services:**
  - **Services/DataService.cs:** Provides methods `LoadTodos()` and `SaveTodos(ObservableCollection<TodoItem> todos)` using JSON file storage with proper try-catch error handling.
- **Views:**
  - **Views/MainWindow.xaml & MainWindow.xaml.cs:** Main UI window featuring a modern layout with a header (including a dark/light theme toggle), a ListView for displaying ToDos, and buttons for CRUD operations.
  - **Views/NewTodoWindow.xaml & NewTodoWindow.xaml.cs:** A dedicated window for adding/editing tasks with input fields for Title, Description, Due Date (using DatePicker), Priority (ComboBox), and Category.
- **Styles:**
  - **Styles/LightTheme.xaml:** Contains resource definitions (colors, fonts, spacing) for the light theme.
  - **Styles/DarkTheme.xaml:** Contains corresponding dark theme definitions.

## Step-by-Step Changes

1. **Setup the WPF Solution & Project:**
   - Create a new WPF solution named "TodoApp" and add a project targeting the appropriate .NET version.

2. **Implement the Data Model:**
   - In `Models/TodoItem.cs`, define a `TodoItem` class with properties:
     - `Guid Id`
     - `string Title`
     - `string Description`
     - `DateTime DueDate`
     - `string Category`
     - `PriorityLevel Priority` (an enum: Low, Medium, High)
     - `bool IsCompleted`
   - Include necessary data annotations and INotifyPropertyChanged if dynamic updates are required.

3. **Create the Data Persistence Service:**
   - In `Services/DataService.cs`, implement:
     - `ObservableCollection<TodoItem> LoadTodos()` to read from a JSON file (create the file if it does not exist).
     - `void SaveTodos(ObservableCollection<TodoItem> todos)` to persist changes.
   - Wrap file I/O operations within try-catch blocks to capture and handle errors gracefully.

4. **Develop the Main ViewModel:**
   - In `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`, implement:
     - An `ObservableCollection<TodoItem> Todos` property.
     - ICommand implementations (using a RelayCommand) for Add, Edit, and Delete commands.
     - Logic to open `NewTodoWindow` for creating or modifying tasks.
     - A DispatcherTimer that periodically checks for tasks close to their DueDate and triggers reminders (e.g., show a MessageBox notification).

5. **Design the Main Window UI:**
   - In `Views/MainWindow.xaml`:
     - Use a Grid layout with a header section showing the app title.
     - Add a Toggle (e.g., a CheckBox styled as a modern switch) to change between dark and light themes.
     - Configure a ListView to display each ToDo’s Title, DueDate, and Priority in a clean, modern style.
     - Place buttons (“Add Todo”, “Edit Todo”, “Delete Todo”) with flat styling, ample spacing, and responsive hover effects.
   - In `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, bind the DataContext to an instance of `MainViewModel`.

6. **Design the New Todo Window UI:**
   - In `Views/NewTodoWindow.xaml`:
     - Use a clean Grid layout to define form fields:
       - TextBox for Title.
       - Multi-line TextBox for Description.
       - DatePicker for DueDate.
       - ComboBox for Priority (populated with enum values).
       - ComboBox or TextBox for Category.
     - Add “Save” and “Cancel” buttons, ensuring input validation and error display (e.g., inline messages).
     
7. **Implement Theme (Dark/Light) Support:**
   - In `Styles/LightTheme.xaml` and `Styles/DarkTheme.xaml`, define modern UI resources (colors, font families, margin values).
   - In `App.xaml`, merge the appropriate resource dictionary based on the current theme.
   - In `App.xaml.cs`, add a method `SwitchTheme(string theme)` that dynamically replaces the merged dictionary at runtime when the user toggles the theme.

8. **Error Handling & Best Practices:**
   - In all file I/O and user input operations, use try-catch blocks and validate inputs.
   - Ensure all user commands are debounced and that UI updates are performed via INotifyPropertyChanged.
   - Maintain separation of concerns by keeping business logic in ViewModels and data operations in Services.

## Summary

- Create a WPF solution "TodoApp" with a proper folder structure for Models, ViewModels, Services, Views, and Styles.
- Implement a robust TodoItem model including title, description, due date, priority, and category.
- Use a DataService to persist data via JSON, handling errors gracefully.
- Develop modern UI windows (MainWindow and NewTodoWindow) using a clean Grid layout, custom typography, and spacing.
- Incorporate MVVM pattern with command binding, and a dark/light theme toggling mechanism.
- Add reminders via a DispatcherTimer that checks due dates.
- Follow best practices by using error handling and input validations, ensuring maintainability and a pleasant user experience.
